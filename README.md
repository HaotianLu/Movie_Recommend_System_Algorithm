## Project 4: Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation: Collaborative Filtering

+ Project summary: In this project we explore different approaches to matrix factorization on ml-small dataset. Specifically, when performing matrix factorization with user and movie biases, as well as global bias, we explore what post-processing will improve performance. When we apply KNN post processing we see few improvements. Meanwhile, after applying KRR the results do improve.
